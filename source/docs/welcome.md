# Hey ðŸ‘‹, welcome to Dev Snippets!

Dev Snippets is (or intends to be) a collection of useful code snippets for new developers. 

Initially this started as a little personal project, just somewhere for me to save those little snippets of code, that I need every so often but that I can never remember. 

Unfortunately, like most side projects, I've not really had time to get it going. However, with [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) looming, I thought why not resurrect it, opening it up for others to contribute to, helping people make their first open source contribution's, whilst building an awesome set of snippets for us all to use!  

### Contributing 

There are no hard and fast rules here, so please feel free to [contribute](https://github.com/rickwest/devsnippets) by opening a pull request adding your snippet. This isn't a new idea so check out projects like [DevHints](https://devhints.io/) for inspiration. 

...And if you're still not sure, or you need some help, just [open an issue](https://github.com/rickwest/devsnippets/issues/new) or drop me a message [@rick_west8](https://twitter.com/rick_west8) and I'll do my best to guide you through it!
